# Control Design and Analysis Tools Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring analysis tools and control design techniques learned during the course. The objective is to apply various control systems concepts to solve different problems, each with a similar degree of complexity. Each group will develop analytical solutions to the proposed problems, which should be implemented using MATLAB/Simulink. The final simulations must demonstrate and validate the theoretical conclusions reached during the analysis.

## Key Objectives

- Apply control analysis and design tools.
- Solve control problems of comparable complexity.
- Implement theoretical solutions using MATLAB/Simulink.
- Validate the theoretical results through simulations.

## Tools and Technologies

- **MATLAB**: For implementing analytical solutions and performing calculations.
- **Simulink**: For modeling, simulating, and validating control systems.
- **Control Toolbox**: MATLABâ€™s toolbox for control system design and analysis.

## Deliverables

1. **Analytical Solutions**: Detailed solutions to the assigned control problems, showing the application of control analysis techniques.
2. **MATLAB/Simulink Code**: Code implementing the solutions, including relevant scripts, functions, and Simulink models.
3. **Simulation Results**: Simulations demonstrating that the theoretical conclusions hold true and validating the effectiveness of the control design.

## Project Structure

- **/src**: Contains the MATLAB scripts and functions used for the analysis and control design.
- **/simulations**: Includes Simulink models and simulation setup files.
- **/results**: Stores the results from the simulations, such as plots and data outputs.
- **/documentation**: Contains the README file and any additional reports or notes.

## Steps to Get Started
